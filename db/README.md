# Audit Infrastructure Database Scripts

This directory contains SQL scripts for the audit infrastructure verification and setup.

## Files

- `09_continuous_verification.sql` - Continuous verification script that validates the audit infrastructure is working correctly

## Usage

These scripts are designed to work with a Supabase PostgreSQL database and verify that:
- The audit schema exists
- Audit tables are properly configured
- Basic audit functionality is operational

## CI/CD Integration

The scripts are integrated with GitHub Actions for continuous verification of the audit infrastructure. The workflow gracefully handles cases where database connectivity is not available in CI environments.
