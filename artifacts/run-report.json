Frontend files patched with: (1) Hero.jsx with dominant CTA, (2) IntakeForm.jsx with fetchWithRetries and demo fallback, (3) ProfileCard.jsx with robust accessors, (4) fetchWithRetries.js with retry logic and correlation IDs, (5) styles.css with CTA prominence. Function stub created at artifacts/function-patch/score-checker/index.js and requires deployment by maintainers. Network checks and deployment skipped due to restricted environment. Branch feat/factora-ui created with all changes committed. Next actions: (1) Push feat/factora-ui branch using report_progress tool, (2) Maintainers deploy function stub from artifacts/function-patch/, (3) Run smoke tests in production environment, (4) Deploy to GitHub Pages via CI/CD."
